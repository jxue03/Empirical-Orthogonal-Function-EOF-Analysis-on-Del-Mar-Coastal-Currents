Used EOF analysis to examine the dominant time-depth variability of the current field by combining the eastward (u) and northward (v) velocity components and decomposing them into orthogonal modes.. Mode 1 accounted for 62.84% of the total variance, capturing the dominant covarying pattern in the dataset; mode 2 accounted for 13.22%; each subsequent mode maintained orthogonality while explaining progressively less variance. The first four modes explained nearly 90% of the total variance, indicating that the leading EOFs effectively reduced dimensionality while preserving the most significant variability patterns.
